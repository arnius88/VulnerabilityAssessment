<h1>Vulnerability Assessment Document</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

For this project I conducted a vulnerability assessment for a small company. A [vulnerability assessment](https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/vulnerability_assessment) is is the internal review process of an organizationâ€™s security systems. 
<br />

To complete the assessment I followed the recommendations provided by the [NIST SP 800-30 Rev.1](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-30r1.pdf), which is a publication that provides guidance on performing risk assessments. The document outlines strategies for identifying, analyzing, and remediating risks. Organizations use NIST SP 800-30 Rev.1 to gain insights into the potential likelihood and severity of risks. The document can help organizations make informed decisions about allocating resources, implementing controls, and prioritizing remediation efforts.

<h2>Scenario</h2>

>You are a newly hired cybersecurity analyst for an e-commerce company. The company stores information on a remote database server, since many of the employees work remotely from locations all around the world. Employees of the company regularly query, or request, data from the server to find potential customers. The database has been open to the public since the company's launch three years ago. As a cybersecurity professional, you recognize that keeping the database server open to the public is a serious vulnerability.
<br />

>A vulnerability assessment of the situation can help you communicate the potential risks with decision makers at the company. You must create a written report that clearly explains how the vulnerable server is a risk to business operations and how it can be secured.
