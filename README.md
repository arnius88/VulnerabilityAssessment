<h1>Vulnerability Assessment Document</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

For this project I conducted a vulnerability assessment for a small company. A [vulnerability assessment](https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/vulnerability_assessment) is is the internal review process of an organizationâ€™s security systems. 
<br />

To complete the assessment I followed the recommendations provided by the [NIST SP 800-30 Rev.1](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-30r1.pdf), which is a publication that provides guidance on performing risk assessments. The document outlines strategies for identifying, analyzing, and remediating risks. Organizations use NIST SP 800-30 Rev.1 to gain insights into the potential likelihood and severity of risks. The document can help organizations make informed decisions about allocating resources, implementing controls, and prioritizing remediation efforts.
<br />

In my [vulnerability assessment report](https://github.com/arnius88/VulnerabilityAssessment/blob/main/Vulnerability%20assessment%20report.pdf) I included the following points:
<br />

- _System description_, highlighting the relevant components, architecture and dependencies of the system being assessed. These parts make up the attack surface of the information system.<br />

- _Scope_, specifying the focus of the assessment.<br />

- _Purpose_, to help stakeholders understand the underlying objective and intended outcome of the analysis.<br />

- _Risk Assessment_, including three Threat Sources and three Threat Events. For each of these, I estimated a Likelihood score (1-3) and a Severity scores (1-3). Based on these, I then calculated a Risk score (likelihood * severity = risk).<br />

- _Approach_, to help stakeholders understand the thought process behind the evaluation of the risks that I identified.<br />

- _Remediation strategy_, providing actionable steps that can be taken to fix vulnerabilities to avoid threats.<br />

<h2>Scenario</h2>

>You are a newly hired cybersecurity analyst for an e-commerce company. The company stores information on a remote database server, since many of the employees work remotely from locations all around the world. Employees of the company regularly query, or request, data from the server to find potential customers. The database has been open to the public since the company's launch three years ago. As a cybersecurity professional, you recognize that keeping the database server open to the public is a serious vulnerability.<br />
>
>A vulnerability assessment of the situation can help you communicate the potential risks with decision makers at the company. You must create a written report that clearly explains how the vulnerable server is a risk to business operations and how it can be secured.
